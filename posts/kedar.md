# Kedar

## Chapter 1

Kedar is a world of dragons, demons, and monsters. These dark creatures constantly war for control of the land, leaving the few human kingdoms in the shadow of a dark and powerful force. But now, the kingdoms of man are fighting back, slowly assembling an army to reclaim their world.

You are Gwen, a female half-demon warden in Caldion, a city in the kingdom of Kedarn. You've been traveling for many years and have come to Caldion to rest and find a place to call home. You've heard that King Kedarn is a just ruler who is fighting against the forces of evil. You've decided to join his army and rid the world of evil.

The world of Kedar is a magical world. Demons were once the dominant species, but were bound to an enchantment so powerful that it destroyed their ability to create other demons simply by focusing their will.

You scoff at the idea of helping the city out. You were never seen as an equal, by anyone, only because you're half-demon. Humans and Demons alike treated you like garbage, or like you were not worth their time. But at least this will pay well. You are a great Warden after all, especially with your Dragon Companion Steph.

You make sure your weapons are packed, and put on your armor. You straighten your armor and make sure every piece is in its place. You check your blade, it's as sharp as ever.
Before entering the Building, you make sure that Steph stays close enough to you. You two can communicate with telepathy, which is a great advantage in the field. You pat Steph, and then enter the Building.

You walk down the hallways, your boots clinking on the metal plating that make up the hallway. You make a few turns, before you see the large steel doors with the Emperor's portrait on it.
You stare at the portrait and scoff. "It's always a Man. Always the patriarchy." You say to yourself.
You enter the room alongside the portrait. A large desk sits in the center of the room, and several leather chairs surround it.

"This must be the meeting room." you say to yourself. Wondering where to sit down, and you take the first best chair. Waiting for others to join.

You sit in the chair and wait. You watch as a group of demons enter, two of them guards, the rest advisors. They stare at you with a mix of desire and hate.

You give them the same stare they are giving you. You will not be treated differently than them, you are an equal to them. You all are in this war together, so you have to get along.
The advisors begin talking amongst themselves, ignoring you. The guards stand firm by their sides, refusing to so much as shift.

You cough, to make clear you're also in the room and should not be ignored. The advisors look at you, and then decide to talk amongst themselves once again. You sigh, tapping the arm of the chair in annoyance.

"If we could start the meeting and get to the point instead of you all gossiping, that would be great." you say out loud. "I want the meeting to start."

You hear someone chuckling, and you turn to find yourself staring at the portrait. The Emperor is clearly chuckling, a smile on his face.

"I imagine you might be feeling a little left out, that the rest of my loyal subjects are ignoring you." the Emperor says.

"Is the portrait talking to me?" you think to yourself. "No, I must have imagined it." you reassured yourself. "No, I do speak to you." says the Emperor again inside your head. "I can read your mind, you know."

You blush and look down, trying to hide the fact you're mentally-spelled.
"I can't be the only one crazy enough to do that."

"DO you also hear the Emperor talk, Steph?" you try to make a connection to Steph, waiting outside for you. "Yes, I do." she replied.

You begin to feel slightly unwell, the room beginning to spin. The guards enter with more people, two of them bringing a screaming girl in front of you.

Distracted from the now screaming girl, you stare at her and then at the guard. With a puzzled look on your face you try to understand what is going on. Someone else enters the room. Another demon, with sleek horns and long hair. "I am glad you all could join us. Come, please take a seat." he starts to say, as he gestures to the advisors to take a seat. The little girl is following him. "I am sure you all are aware of what will happen next."

## Chapter 2

The advisores are as confused as I am. I look back at the little girl, then I look back at the Emperor's Portrait. And it clicks. She's the emperor's daughter! "Why is she here?" you ask the demon.
"We are having a ritual to summon Ataros, the spirit of Mother Earth." he explains.
You nod, slowly beginning to understand.

"But why is she important?" you ask. "why do we need her to summon Ataros?"
The demon looks at you, obviously annoyed that you do not understand. "We need her to invoke Ataros' wrath. It's a necessary part of the ritual, or else Mother Earth will not answer."
"So you want to invoke Ataros' wrath, so Mother Earth will appear," you repeat. "What exactly will the Emperor's Daughter do to invoke Ataros?"

"The Emperor's daughter will die. She will be sacrificed."
You almost gasp at that comment. "Wh... why?"
"Without the sacrifice of the Emp..."

"And the Emperor is fine with sacrificing his own Daughter?" You asked, a bit shocked. But it shouldn't surprise you, since Demons are capable of anything, even killing their own kin.
"I wouldn't," the demon replies, glaring at you. "But the Emperor is remorseless. He cares nothing for his daughter, and sees only the magical energy he could gain from her death.
"I understand." you say. "Alright, and once Mother Earth has responded, what will we do? What's the plan?"

"We'll invade, of course." the demon says, as though it's the most obvious thing in the world.
You scoff. "You think Mother Earth will help you out? Why would she?" You roll your eyes. Mother Earth cares about her planet, so why would she help to invade other civilisations, that is nonsense.
The demon glares at you, obviously irritated by your expression of doubt. "She will. She has to."
You glare at the demon. Then to the girl, and the other demons in the room. You stand up, look back at the first demon and say "Alright. Tell me, what is your name?"

"Mynameis Neroth." He replies, obviously irritated that you don't know the name he's known by for years.
"Then let's get started, Neroth." you say and are ready to leave the building. The girl still sobbing in the background, as Neroth is preparing her to go to another room. "Steph, I'm coming out now." you say in your head, telling her telepathically.

The demon suddenly glares at you, looking menacing. "Are you sure you know what you're doing?"
You smirk, then nod. "Of course."

## Chapter 3

You go outside, stretching your arms and legs, when you suddenly hear a loud "thud" above you. Steph has landed on the building's roof and is looking down to you. "So what's the plan?" she asks you.
"The plan is..." you begin to say, then you pause, noticing some movement in the alley across the street. A large figure similar to a human, but much larger stands there.
"Who's there!?" you demand loudly while drawing your sword. You're slowly approaching the figure in the alley, and yet they're not running away.
The figure slowly starts to raise its hands up. "Woah, hey! It's just me!" the figure says. You slow down, and the figure comes closer to you.
You look at the figure and realise, it's an old friend. "Nera? Is that you?"
The figure nods.

"What are you doing here?"

"I heard You were in town, so I decided to pay You a visit..." Nera replies, looking around.
"I don't really have the time for visits, you know? I was hired to do a job, something... something secret. I'd rather not say it." you say carefully, unsure if other demons are also watching you. Steph is still sitting on the roof, observing you and Nera. "Did you wanted anything specific, Nera?"
"No, not really. Just stopping by I guess. How have You been? Are You still killing demons?" Nera asks with a smirk.

You scowl in response.

"Why would you bring that up? Someone could hear you! What do you really want, Nera? I don't have time to play stupid games." you hiss at her, your eyes flaring up in red. Nera just smirks at you. You just know that she wants something done, and it can't be anything good.
You take a deep breath, trying to ignore the situation and stay calm. You can't let your anger get the better of you, or else it will be the end of you.
"So I heard you have some mission to accompany the Emperor's daughter." Nera starts, you're sensing something bad is coming towards you. "I know of Ataros, Gwen. And I want the ashes." You look puzzled. "The ashes?" Nera nods, slowly removing herself from the scene. "You'll know what I'm talking about, once you see it." and then she's gone.
Behind you you hear a door being open and closed. Some guards and advisors are leaving the building, with the Emperor's Daughter. "You there, Half-Blood! Come here." one guard yells to you, and so you do as you were told. "Yes?" you ask.
The guard, one of the newer ones appears to be about your age. "What's your name?" he demands to know.
"Gwen." you respond, with a stern face.
"So, Gwen." he starts to speak. "You are supposed to accompany the troop, together with the emperor's daughter, to Ataro's grave." he explains. "There she will be sacrificed. Make sure she won't run away." he adds, with an angry tone in his voice. "I won't", you answer. You see the troop at the gate, waiting. With the Emperor's Daughter already there, in cuffs. You walk to the troop to start your journey.
You and the troop set off, through the long corridor. You see the city behind you, the lights of the city beautiful.
But you also see the dark parts of the city, covered in a dark mist. The plague has got to that part, and it's not looking good. You turn around and keep walking. You're all now well outside the city, marching towards Ataros' Grave.
"So what is Ataros' Grave like? What should I expect?" you ask a troop member. They tell you that it's small, and spooky. The ground is all rocks, and the sky is all black. Shadows cast upon the ground of their own accord.
You nod to that information. That doesn't sound like an inviting place at all. You look to the emperor's daughter. Still no one told you what her name is. You whisper: "What is the name of the emperor's daughter anyway?"
"Hm? Oh, I'm not sure."
"It would be a good idea to know her name, so we can call her that when we sacrifice her."
The soldier looks surprised, as if not to expect something intelligent to come from Gwen. Demons and People alike think less of Half-Demons, so it's to be expected. "Right." he just says, and walkds off to another guard. Probably asking for the name of the emperor's daughter.
Gwen stands there watching him go, then looks at you. "Do you want the name of the girl who will soon be in great danger?"
You nod eagerly.
"Cesspier." the other soldiers tells you. Cesspier looks up, when she hears her name, but realises quick, that no one is talking directly to her, only about her. She is being held by a rope, and being dragged along that way. You look to the horizon, the sky slowly getting dark.
The ground writhes, and the sky turns black. Shadows take form, forming of the mist into horrible creatures.
You take a quick look around, and announce "I take it we're here?" Nobody answers, and you take a big gulp. This is it.
Suddenly, the Emperor's daughter breaks free from her guards, and starts to struggle against them.
You quickly turn around to run to the struggling Cesspier, but she managed to spit fire on the rope to burn it down. That gave her time to escape from the soldiers, while they're distracted by the fire. You try to run after her.
A dark voice calls out to you "Wait, you must choose your path."
You look back, and see a creature.
The creature is tall and suddenly everything around you is engulfed in shadow. You can hear fainted voices, yelling of what is going on. The creatures approaches you, it must be over 2 meters tall. You anticipate the next move. The creature hasn't got a face, only black holes for eyes. It's skin seems to bestretched over bones. The creature holds out a hand, as if to stop you. Then, it yawns.
